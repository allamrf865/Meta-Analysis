# Magnesium Sulfate in Supratentorial Craniotomy

This repository serves as the digital archive for the systematic review and meta-analysis titled "Magnesium Sulfate as a Multimodal Adjuvant in Supratentorial Craniotomy". The study evaluates the efficacy of intraoperative Magnesium Sulfate (MgSO4) regarding hemodynamics, analgesia, and neuroprotection in adult patients.

The datasets included in this repository are organized to ensure transparency and reproducibility. The '01_Data' folder contains the raw extraction sheets for outcomes such as Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP), S100B biomarkers, and blood loss volume, alongside the Risk of Bias assessment tables. 

For the statistical component, the '02_Analysis' folder houses the Review Manager (RevMan 5) files used to generate the pooled effect sizes and forest plots. High-resolution versions of these figures, including the PRISMA flow diagram, can be found in the '03_Figures' folder.

This meta-analysis is registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251238665) and utilizes a random-effects model for data synthesis. If you use these datasets, please cite the associated manuscript or refer to the Zenodo DOI provided in the release section.
